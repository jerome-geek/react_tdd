# TDD(Test Driven Development)

**Write the test first, and the code after**

## What is Test Driven Development?

- Coding of features and tests go hand in hand

1. Write a unit test
2. Run the test. See it fail
3. Write the feature code to pass the test
4. Refactor the code

## Why Test Driven Development?

- It reducers error and defects in the long run
- It leads to higher quality code

## Jest + Enzyme = TDD with React

### Jest

- A test runner made by Facebook
- Write tests in the `__tests__` folder or with `test.js`
- Snapshot testing, coverage, and mocking

### Enzyme

- A test utility library made by Airbnb
- Manipulate React components and DOM behavior
